            Come back to the sea<br>
Where the forest with its fir trees<br>
Bow their heads in snow greetings<br>
Where the town sleeps and the sea freeze<br>
And you think it wont ever melt<br>
Where the wind is violent<br>
So we raise the sails up<br>
Where the ancient mountains<br>
Are the ruler of us<br>

Like an echo in the forest<br>
Haruga doraogetji<br>
Amu ildo eopdan deusi<br>
Yeah life goes on<br>
Like an arrow in the blue sky<br>
Tto haru deo naragaji<br>
On my pillow, on my table<br>
Yeah life goes on<br>
Like this again
